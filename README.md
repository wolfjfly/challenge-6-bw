Server-Side APIs Challenge: Weather Dashboard

 <Challenge 6>

## Description
Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
Use the 5 Day Weather Forecast

AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
